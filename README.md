# Learning_Analysis
- This repository will be mostly updated with what I've been developing in Data Science as part of my learning process. I'll also add relevant things that I've been experimenting with.
- This repository will be used to present analysis on different datasets that I've been working on, for tests and experimentations on different models and data work techniques go to the ["**Learning_Test**"](https://github.com/rfvianna/Learning_Test) repository.
